This view provides a high-level summary of your parachainâ€™s Coretime activity. It's designed to give you immediate insight into your current status and renewal needs, including:

- Which cores are renewable this cycle
- The cost efficiency of renewal vs. new purchases
- Current auction pricing trends
- A history of purchases and actions

Use this dashboard to monitor, manage, and plan your Coretime usage effectively.`,

      text: `**Renewable Cores Panel**

This section lists all cores that are eligible for renewal during the current sale cycle. Each item includes:

- Para ID and its identicon
- A "Renew Now" button for direct renewal
- Time remaining until the renewal window closes
- The renewal cost in real time

If all renewable cores have already been renewed, a confirmation message is displayed.  
This ensures you never miss a deadline or double-check unnecessarily.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Renew during the **interlude phase** to avoid losing priority. Renewals submitted late are not guaranteed to be processed in time.`,

      text: `**Renewal vs New Core Price Comparison**

This section helps you decide whether to renew a core or purchase a new one based on current pricing:

- Shows the **current auction price** for new cores
- Shows the **calculated renewal price** for your existing cores
- Highlights if renewal is cheaper, equal, or more expensive

If renewing is less efficient, a warning is shown so you can make the best decision financially.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Prices can shift quickly. Use this comparison to plan ahead or time your renewals strategically.`,

This widget displays the current auction phase and time progress for the ongoing sale cycle.

Phases:
- **Leadin**: Core prices decrease block-by-block.
- **Fixed Price**: Price is locked; only renewals and late buys happen.
- **Interlude**: Window to submit renewals before the next cycle.

The visual ring shows:
- Progress through the current phase
- When the next phase begins

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Use this to time renewals or new purchases â€” especially if you're targeting optimal pricing in Leadin or submitting during Interlude.`,

**Dutch Auction Chart**

This interactive graph visualizes how core prices evolve over time within the Dutch auction cycle.

- **Blue curve**: historical or simulated pricing as blocks progress.
- **Green marker**: current block and active core price.
- **Y-axis**: price in DOT.
- **X-axis**: block timeline from start to end of the sale cycle.

The auction begins with a high initial price that decreases linearly over the **Leadin** phase. Once the **Fixed Price** phase begins, the price stops decreasing and remains constant. During the **Interlude**, new purchases are no longer accepted, but renewals can still be submitted.

Use this chart to:
- Identify ideal entry points for core purchases.
- Predict when your target price may be reached.
- Understand historical buying behavior from previous cycles.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Many buyers place bulk orders once prices hit a psychological threshold. If you're waiting too long, you may miss the purchase window entirely â€” especially in high-demand cycles.

      text: `**Cores Remaining**

This section displays a real-time chart showing how many Coretime units are still available for purchase during the current sale cycle.

What it shows:
- The total number of cores offered at the start of the cycle
- A line graph showing the remaining cores over time
- The current number of available cores (left of the chart)

The graph updates as purchases occur, with each drop representing a new sale. This lets you visually assess demand and competition over time.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: A steep drop early in the sale is a strong signal that high-demand bulk buyers are active. When remaining cores reach 0, the current sale cycle is effectively sold out for new buyers.`,

This section allows you to manage and renew core allocations for your selected parachain.

Here's what you can do:
- Select a parachain from the dropdown to view its renewal status
- View its name, Para ID, project logo, and website link (if available)
- See the current state of the parachain (e.g., Active, Idle, Renewable) along with a description of what that means
- Check the renewal cost and the deadline to submit the renewal before the interlude ends
- Use the **Renew** button to directly initiate a core renewal transaction for the selected parachain

If no core is available for renewal, the Renew button will not appear.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Submitting your renewal during the interlude phase ensures the best chance of inclusion in the next cycle. Missed renewals could lead to region loss or delays.`,
